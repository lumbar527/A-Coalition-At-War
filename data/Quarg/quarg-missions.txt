One of the Quarg turns to you and says, "In view of your recent contributions to our defense against the Coalition, we have chosen to give you an honorary position as a Quarg warrior. You now have access to select Quarg outfits once you depart and land again. There may be a special mission or two on the job board. You are also a fugitive from the Coalition.`

    dialog `You tell the Quarg how powerful the new ships are and how they appeared to use Skylances as well as salvaged Sheragi technology. They took out several Quarg ships before they were taken down. The Quarg in charge grimly thanks you for the information. "We must make preparations to counter this new threat."`
    dialog `Since you have proven yourself trustworthy, we do not want you to be unable to survive future missions. We are therefore allowing you to purchase our normal ships. They are not cheap, so we will also let you purchase antimatter cores. If you are caught sharing any of our technology with anyone else, we will destroy you.`
    dialog `You are happy that you can now buy Quarg ships and antimatter cores, but you don't like the sound of "we will destroy you if you share our technology with anyone else". They really don't want it falling into the wrong hands.`
    dialog `You must leave and land again to gain access to the shipyard.`
