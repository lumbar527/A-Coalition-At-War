	description "These advanced repair modules are issued only to the Heliarch Punishers defending the wormhole system, providing hull repair unparalleled in all of Coalition space. The legions of small repair drones come with the extensive pathways they use to quickly get around a ship, and as such the outfit can interfere with a ship's cooling and heat dissipation systems."

	description "This Quantum Deionizer makes you virtually immune to ion damage at a high cost. The ion sheath it creates gives a 10% reduction to shield & hull damage. It slows down your ship A LOT, uses a lot of WEAPON space, and might be the hottest outfit. Is immunity worth it? I don't know. Seems like someone could just kill you with a flamethrower."
