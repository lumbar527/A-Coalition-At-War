			`You find Freya and Alondo watching over a large hangar where several hundred Navy crew and support staff are being kept under guard. Alondo says, "I contacted the Navy admirals. They say Katya is not under their control; she is a prisoner of the Intelligence bureau, and arranging her release could take weeks. But they promised that if we return their prisoners now, they will ensure Katya's release and return her to us soon."`
			choice
				`	"How do we know they won't break that promise?"`
				`	"Why not just keep the prisoners until we have Katya back safely?"`
			`	Freya sighs. "Alondo claims that the admirals value their honor so highly that we can trust their promise. I am not so sure. Even if the admirals do their best, what if Intelligence refuses to honor the deal we make?"`
			`	Alondo says, "On the other hand, if we release these prisoners on parole as a gesture of good faith, it could bring us much closer to a diplomatic end to this war. Which would be far preferable to another battle as bloody as this one."`
			`	Freya says, "And meanwhile, JJ is off on a top secret mission. And that means he's not available to consult with, and we need to make this decision now."`
			`	"And since we cannot agree," says Alondo, "we are giving you the deciding vote."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean?"`
			`	"We will be putting you in charge of the prisoner convoy," says Alondo, "and arranging a week of safe passage for you. If you think we should return the prisoners as a gesture of goodwill to improve our chances of a diplomatic end to this war, bring the convoy to <planet>."`
			`	"But if you think we should hold on to the prisoners until we receive Katya safely back," says Freya, "bring the convoy to Clink. Understand?"`
			`	It's a serious choice facing you, with no clear right decision. You thank them for trusting you, and begin preparations to escort the prisoners.`

			`<origin> has become the home of a major Navy base almost overnight; the number of ships and people here is almost overwhelming. You return the prisoners, who have all taken an oath of parole to take no further part in the war against the Free Worlds. One of the four Navy admirals who you and Alondo met with earlier is here, and as you are unloading the prisoners, he says, "More volunteers for the 'Oathkeepers,' I see."`
			choice
				`	"Who are the 'Oathkeepers'?"`
			`	"The officers you granted parole to months ago. We reassigned them all to duty in the north, patrolling for pirates."`
			`	"You mean they really do honor their promise not to fight us?" you ask.`
			`	"Of course. They swore a vow, after all." You suspect it's not quite that simple, but decide that questioning this admiral's word would be pointless. As you are getting ready to leave, he says, "Don't worry, we will be returning Miss Reynolds to you shortly. The ship carrying her should arrive here in a week or two."`
			`	You hope he is telling the truth. Now, it is time to meet with Freya and Alondo and decide what should be done next.`
