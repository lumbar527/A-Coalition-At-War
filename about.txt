Pick a side in the war between the Coalition and Quarg. Gain access to that side's technology and ships.

You can start the few implemented missions by landing on "Tebuteb's Table" in the Tebuteb system or Forpelog in the Sadalsuud system and accepting the anamoly mission.

Please consider giving me a mission idea https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/issues/new/choose
