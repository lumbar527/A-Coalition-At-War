# A Coalition at War

You hear a lot about the conflict between the Coalition and the Quarg in Endless Sky, but you don't ever see it. 

This plugin will introduce a storyline that lets you see that conflict and even capture Heliarch ships if you are so inclined (after farming reputation by repairing Heliarch ships).

Land on Tebuteb's Table in the Tebuteb system and you be asked to investigate an anomaly. Accept the mission and you'll be on your way.

# Contributing

The story needs work. Give me story ideas and I might turn them into missions.
