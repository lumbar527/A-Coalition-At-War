# A Coalition at War

You hear a lot about the conflict between the Coalition and the Quarg in Endless Sky, but you don't see it. 

This plugin will introduce a storyline that lets you see that conflict and even capture Heliarch ships.

There's only one mission currently. See "Contributing" below if you have any ideas for more.

# Getting Started

Land on Tebuteb's Table in the Tebuteb system and you will be asked to investigate an anomaly. Accept the mission and you'll be on your way.

# Contributing

The story needs work. Give me story ideas and I might turn them into missions.
